# Supervised Machine Learning

This project work with a dataset of properties for sale in Argentina,  published on the Properati portal and provided from Ac√°mica in order to carry out the stipulated projects (Sprint 1 and 2)

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks:
- DS_Proyecto_01: Preliminary EDA and supervised machine learning models such KNNeighbors, linear regression and decision tree regressor. Best model is selected as benchmark model to compare preprocessing results in the next stage of modeling (in Advanced_ML.ipynb)
- Advanced_ML: Preprocessing(Outlier detection, encoders, dimensional reduction) and advanced modeling with XGboost and Random Forest
